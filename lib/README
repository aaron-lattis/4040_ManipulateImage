This program will display, and perform manipulations on, an image provided on the command line.

To compile the program, type 'make' and then 'make paint'. This will create an executable 'img_paint' file.

To run the program type './img_paint -image <image>' where <image> is the path to an image.

When the program is run, the image will be displayed. Additionally, the terminal will display which keboard buttuns will cause which manipulations to occur. When a key that corresponds to a manipulation is pressed, a new image with the specified manipulations applied will be shown in place of the old image.
